# Shaper

Shaper is a nifty little form builder replacement for Ruby on Rails. It
provides state-of-the-art interaction improvements using advanced browser
tricks.

Hah, did that catch your attention? No? Wellâ€¦ boo. Maybe the following
list will impress.

* Automatic focus of the first invalid form field
* Validation messages near the source of the problem

## Userfullness?

In it's current state the form builder is extracted from three production
applications. That means it works.

We're looking into making it more flexible without having to give up speed
or ease of use.
